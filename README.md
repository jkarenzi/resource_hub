# ResourceHub

This is a small group project created by 6 students from the University of African Leadership. The aim was to test our programming skillset and try to create a useful website for a particular community and we came up with *RESOURCE HUB*. This website is for the students currently attend ALU and struggle to find right source materials to study as the Intranet is not very user friendly.
